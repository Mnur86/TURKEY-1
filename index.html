  <h1>TURKEY</h1>  
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Let me give you a brief history about Turkey.</p> 
<p>The name Turkey is derived from Middle <em>Latin</em> Turchia, i.e. the <strong>"land of the Turks"</strong>, historically referring to an entirely different territory of <em><strong>Eastern Europe</em></strong> and <em><strong>Central Asia</em></strong>, which fell under the control of Turkic peoples in the early medieval period. The Republic of Turkey was created after the overthrow of Sultan Mehmet VI Vahdettin by the new Republican Parliament in 1922. This new regime delivered the <em>coup de grâce</em> to the Ottoman state which had been practically wiped away from the world stage following the First World War. And that's how The Republic of Turkey came about. </p>

<h2>Turkish Cusine</h2>
<p>is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Balkan cuisines. Turkish cuisine has in turn influenced those and other neighbouring cuisines, including those of Southeast Europe (Balkans), Central Europe, and Western Europe. The Ottomans fused various culinary traditions of their realm with influences from Levantine cuisines, along with traditional Turkic elements from Central Asia (such as yogurt and mantı), creating a vast array of specialities—many with strong regional associations.</p>
<p>Turkish cuisine varies across the country. The cooking of Istanbul, Bursa, Izmir, Gaziantep, and rest of the Aegean region inherits many elements of Ottoman court cuisine, with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over bulgur, koftes and a wider availability of vegetable stews (türlü), eggplant, stuffed dolmas and fish. The cuisine of the Black Sea Region uses fish extensively, especially the Black Sea anchovy (hamsi) and includes maize dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. Urfa, Gaziantep, and Adana) is famous for its variety of kebabs, mezes and dough-based desserts such as baklava, şöbiyet, kadayıf, and künefe. </p>
